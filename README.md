###Description
Our project is a simple blackjack game that will allow users to play a typical shoe-game of blackjack from the command line (singleplayer) either 1 on 1 with the dealer or with a chosen number of AI’s. For example, the player can choose to play alongside 3 other AI players, or by themselves.
The game will allow for the basic blackjack commands/actions (bet, hit, stand).
Cards will be represented by their number (name for face cards) and a letter {c,d,h,s} to represent suits (clubs, diamonds, hearts, and spades, respectively).
New players will start with $100.
The player will be able to set how many AI’s will play in the game.
AI’s will have a set difficulty level.
